From SYNdicate:

Automate as much as you can.

Scan memory for meterpreter shells and rip them out of memory when found (I think injdmp or something is a tool that can do this?)

The BIND 9 bug the red team often goes for CVE-2015-5477 I think (BIND is a big target, anyway)


Local and host firewall setup is HUGE. That was their secret weapon. 

Be persistent about patching (download the latest versions of the software and apply them)

PSSH to manage multiple Linux machines is an awesome tool, and one we can take advantage of.

Prepare for legacy systems like Solaris and older versions of Linux

Write automated iptables rules if you can.  

MAKE SURE you use SSH private keys. Only authenticate to boxes using those -- don't use passwords.

Do what you can to disable PowerShell (I think setting Constrained Language Mode is the best we can do...?)

"you want one script to run on each box
all automation wrapped up into that one script
and to run it as soon as the game starts
to lock everything down as much as possible
and as soon as possible
having per-machine firewall rules should help a lot
then you just need to worry about patching
which is a slower process
but you can run things like apt-get update on linux
I think there are auto-updater tools out there also, but not sure"
