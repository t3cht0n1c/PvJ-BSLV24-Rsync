## Some notes from preivous DEFCON talks
# other tricks welcome! 

# screwing with command + process substitution
diff foo <(sort foo) -> makes sorted version and finds differences from file on disk

# print unqiue lines without sorting
awk '{ if (!seen[$0]++) print }' /tmp/foo
# SSH tricks
ssh -J user@host1 user2@host2 proxy

# copying to clipboard selection
xsel -b < file.txt

# files that snitch
~/.wget-hsts
~/.lesshst
VIM *.swp files .vminfo

# covering track
unset HISTFILE
export HISTFILE=/dev/null
ln -sf /dev/null ~/.bash_history # will make user sad since its now linked forever no more history he will come for u now
history -c; kill -9 $$

# Dont have LS?
echo *
find . -maxdepth 1
